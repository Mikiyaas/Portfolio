## **Introduction**

This is a sample HTML code for a personal code portfolio. It includes a navbar, slider, about us, skills, and contact us sections.

This HTML code is a simple web page layout that includes a navbar, slider, and about us sections. The code uses Bootstrap, a popular front-end development framework, to create a responsive and mobile-friendly website.

The head section of the code contains meta tags that specify the character set and viewport of the website. It also includes links to the Bootstrap CSS and a custom style.css file that contains additional styles.

The navbar section is created using Bootstrap's navbar component. It contains a logo image, a collapsible menu icon, and links to different sections of the website. The menu items are arranged using the navbar-nav class, and the dropdown menu is created using the dropdown component.

The slider section includes an image and a description of the website owner. The section is created using Bootstrap's grid system, which allows for easy layout and positioning of content.

The about us section includes a short description of the website owner and their skills. The section is also created using Bootstrap's grid system, and it includes a heading, job title, location, and a paragraph of text.

Overall, this HTML code is a basic template that can be easily customized and expanded to create a more complex website.
